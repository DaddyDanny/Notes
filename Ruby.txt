3 data types so far:
number, boolean, and string

number is just a number, no quotes
boolean is either 'true' or 'false' without quotation marks
string is text/numbers inside of quotation marks

variables are a word or name set to a value of a data type
they are set with 'variable_name' and '='
'my_num = 25' sets a variable 'my_numb' to the value of 25

math operators:
addition '+'
subtraction '-'
multiplication '*'
division '/'
exponentiation '**'
modulo '%'

'puts' (put string) prints a string or variable to the screen and creates a new line after
'print' just prints a string or variable to the screen and doesn't create a new line
to print a string in the middle of a sentence, use '#{string_name}' in place of a word

string methods:
'string.method' is the syntax

'.length' returns the length of the string
'.reverse' returns the string backwards
'.upcase' returns the string in all caps
'.downcase' returns the string in all lowercase
'.capitalize' returns the string with the first letter capitalized
'.split' takes a string and returns an array

'#' indicates a single-line comment
anything in a comment is not read by the interpreter

'=begin' indicates the start of a multi-line comment
'=end' indicates the end of a multi-line comment
anything between these is not read by the interpreter
no '#'s are required for these comments

naming conventions for variables:
words should always be in lowercase
words should be separated by an underscore '_'
words should only have numbers and letters

'gets' is a method that receives input from a user
Ruby automatically creates a new line after every input
'.chomp' deletes that extra line

when using a method to alter a variable, you can use '!' to avoid reassigning.
example = test
example.capitalize!
results in 'example = Test'

control flow:
'if' statements activate if assigned to a value that is true
starts with 'if', ends with 'end'
'elsif' is an alternate 'if' statement. tests this if the 'if' statement and any other 'elsif' statements above are not true
'else' catches anything not specificially mentioned in 'if' and 'elsif' statements
'unless' activates if assigned to a value that is false

operators:
'=' is an assignment operator, meaning it is used to assign values to variables
example = true

'==' is used as a comparator or relational operator, meaning it checks to see if two things are equal to each other
'!=' is used to check if two values are not equal
'>' '<' '<=' and '>=' are the other comparators

logical/boolean operators are used to produce a 'true' or 'false' value by comparing 2 or more values of 'true' or 'false'.
'&&' or 'and' returns true only if all values being operated upon are true
'||' or 'or' returns true if any of the values being operated upon are true. also called an 'inclusive or'
'!' or 'not' returns the opposite of the value being operated upon
these can be combined in an operation, parentheses can be used and will be treated as they would be in math 'PEMDAS'

'.include?' checks if a string contains a substring. evaluates to true or false

'.gsub' stands for global substitution. substitutes a desginated string with another
syntax - string_to_change.gsub!(/string/, "new_string")

loops:
'while' loops will repeat as long as the terms are true
must remember incrementer to prevent infinite loops 
'until' loop basically backwards 'while' loop.  loop will repeat until terms become true
'for' loop will repeat for a predetermined amount of time

to assign and increment at the same time use '+=' rather than var = var + 1
'-=' '*=' and '/=' all work as well

to set a range, use 'low_number...high_number' this excludes the high_number
to include the high_number, use two dots 'low_number..high_number'

'next' can be used to skip a step if a certain parameter is met

iterators:
'loop' is the simplest iterator
syntax to 'loop' is - 'var = 0 loop do var += 1 print "#{var} break if var > 5 end'
do/end can be replaced by {/}

'.each' is an iterator that will perform a task on every element of an object

'.times' is an super compact 'for' loop

arrays:
arrays are variables with multiple values '[1, 2, 3, 4]'
to access elements from the array, use an index value 'array[i]
index values start at 0, not 1
arrays can contain strings, booleans, numbers, and even other arrays
arrays of arrays are called 'multidimensional arrays'

hashes:
a hash is like an array that contains key-value pairs
hash = {key1 => value1, key2 => value2}
this is hash "literal notation", literally describing the hash

can also use 'Hash.new' to create hashes
'hash = Hash.new' creates an empty hash
add values to the empty hash with:
'hash["key"] = "value"
this is called 'bracket notation'

access values of the hash just like an array 'hash[key]' will return the value of the key-vaue pair

'.sort_by' will sort a hash by the key or value
hash.sort_by {|a, b| a} will sort by the keys

reasons to separate code into methods:
1. easier to find and fix bugs if it is split up and organized
2. by assigning specific tasks to specific methods, you make your program less redundant and your code more reusable (called 'separation of concerns')
3. you can do more with objects

method syntax:
1. header, includes "def", name of the method, and any arguments the method takes
2. the body, describes procedures the method carries out. indented like all statements
3. ends with "end"

to call a method, simply type its name on a line along with any argument provided

paramater is what you put between parenthesis while defining a method
argument is what is between parenthesis while calling a method
parenthesis are usually optional in Ruby, but recommended for readability

splat arguments are arguments preceded by '*' and indicate one or more argument can be received

'return' is used to hand a value back to the user or to another method

a block is like a nameless method similar to anonymous functions in JS and lambdas in Python
can be defined by either keywords 'do' and 'end' or by '{}'

difference between method and block is that a method can be repeatedly called and used while a block is only used once

sorting:
'.sort' will sort an array alphabetically and numerically

'combined comparison operator' compares 2 Ruby objects
looks like <=>
returns 0 if the first operand is equal to the second, 1 if it is greater than
the second, and -1 if it is less than the second

.sort can be used to sort in descending order with a combined comparison operator

array.sort! { |a, b| b <=> a }

.reverse returns the array in opposite order, not necessarily backwards alphabetically

if you try to access a key in a hash that doesn't exist, you return 'nil'
along with 'false', 'nil' is one of two non-true values in Ruby
every other value in Ruby is regarded as 'truthy'
false and nil are not the same thing, false is 'not true' and nil is 'nothing at all'

define a default value other than nil with Hash.new
no_nil_hash = Hash.new("value other than nil")

symbols:
:symbol is an example of a symbol
different from a string in that a string can have multiple copies while there can only be a single copy of a symbol

.object_id tells the id of an object and can tell if two objects are exactly the same object
the same string will have different values while the same symbol will have the same value

symbol syntax:
symbols always start with a colon (:)
after that they must be a valid variable name
this means after the colon must be a letter or underscore (_)
after that, it can be any string of letters, numbers, and underscores

symbols are primarily used as either a hash key or for referencing a method
symbols make a good hash key because:
1. they're immutable, can't be changed
2. only one copy of any symbol exists, so they save memory
3. symbols-as-keys are faster than strings-as-keys for the 2 previous reasons

can convert between strings and symbols with the .to_s (to string) and .to_sym methods
.intern will also 'internalize' a string into a symbol

the hash syntax using '=>' is called hash rocket style
this changed as of Ruby 1.9
the new syntax is hash = {symbol: value}
the colon at the end still makes the key a symbol

.select is used to select a value from a hash

rather than use .each and put both key and value in a block just to use only one
use .each_key or .each_value to use only keys or only values
