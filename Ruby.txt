3 data types so far:
number, boolean, and string

number is just a number, no quotes
boolean is either 'true' or 'false' without quotation marks
string is text/numbers inside of quotation marks

variables are a word or name set to a value of a data type
they are set with 'variable_name' and '='
'my_num = 25' sets a variable 'my_numb' to the value of 25

math operators:
addition '+'
subtraction '-'
multiplication '*'
division '/'
exponentiation '**'
modulo '%'

'puts' (put string) prints a string or variable to the screen and creates a new line after
'print' just prints a string or variable to the screen and doesn't create a new line
to print a string in the middle of a sentence, use '#{string_name}' in place of a word

string methods:
'string.method' is the syntax

'.length' returns the length of the string
'.reverse' returns the string backwards
'.upcase' returns the string in all caps
'.downcase' returns the string in all lowercase
'.capitalize' returns the string with the first letter capitalized

'#' indicates a single-line comment
anything in a comment is not read by the interpreter

'=begin' indicates the start of a multi-line comment
'=end' indicates the end of a multi-line comment
anything between these is not read by the interpreter
no '#'s are required for these comments

naming conventions for variables:
words should always be in lowercase
words should be separated by an underscore '_'
words should only have numbers and letters

'gets' is a method that receives input from a user
Ruby automatically creates a new line after every input
'.chomp' deletes that extra line

when using a method to alter a variable, you can use '!' to avoid reassigning.
example = test
example.capitalize!
results in 'example = Test'

control flow:
'if' statements activate if assigned to a value that is true
starts with 'if', ends with 'end'
'elsif' is an alternate 'if' statement. tests this if the 'if' statement and any other 'elsif' statements above are not true
'else' catches anything not specificially mentioned in 'if' and 'elsif' statements
'unless' activates if assigned to a value that is false

operators:
'=' is an assignment operator, meaning it is used to assign values to variables
example = true

'==' is used as a comparator or relational operator, meaning it checks to see if two things are equal to each other
'!=' is used to check if two values are not equal
'>' '<' '<=' and '>=' are the other comparators

logical/boolean operators are used to produce a 'true' or 'false' value by comparing 2 or more values of 'true' or 'false'.
'&&' or 'and' returns true only if all values being operated upon are true
'||' or 'or' returns true if any of the values being operated upon are true. also called an 'inclusive or'
'!' or 'not' returns the opposite of the value being operated upon
these can be combined in an operation, parentheses can be used and will be treated as they would be in math 'PEMDAS'
